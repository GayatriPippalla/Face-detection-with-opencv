# Face Detection With OpenCV

This is a simple real-time **Face Detection** project using OpenCV and a Haar Cascade Classifier. It uses your system webcam to detect faces and draws rectangles around them.

## Features

- Real-time face detection using webcam
- Haar Cascade Classifier (`haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml`)
- Simple and beginner-friendly implementation

## Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV (cv2)

##  How to Run the Project

### 1. Clone the Repository
https://github.com/GayatriPippalla/Face-detection-with-opencv.git

## 2. Install Requirements
It's recommended to use a virtual environment (optional):

pip install opencv-python

## 3. Download Haar Cascade File
Download the file from:

haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml

Place it in your project directory and update the path in your script if needed.

## 4. Run the Script
python face_detect.py
Press q to exit the webcam window.

 ## Output
The webcam window will display your face with rectangles drawn around detected faces in real-time.
